    "description": "With Application Auto Scaling, you can configure automatic scaling for your\nscalable resources. You can use Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the\nfollowing tasks:\n\n *  Define scaling policies to automatically scale your AWS or custom resources\n   \n   \n *  Scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms\n   \n   \n *  Schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions\n   \n   \n *  View the history of your scaling events\n   \n   \n\nApplication Auto Scaling can scale the following resources:\n\n *  Amazon ECS services. For more information, see Service Auto Scaling\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-auto-scaling.html] \n   in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.\n   \n   \n *  Amazon EC2 Spot fleets.
